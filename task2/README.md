Arrays
===========================================================================================================
sub-task1: Create a class that will generate array filed by numbers in fibonacci
sequence in defined range. 
For ex., I want to get all numbers from fibonacci sequence from 100 to 10000.
    For this I create an instance of this class and invoke method getFibonacciNumbersFromRange with
    two arguments 100 and 10000 on it.

sub-task2: Create a class that will generate array with defined length that will be 
filled by random numbers. Also, create a class which will be sort given array, and returns a sorted 
array as result.

Note:
* not use the static methods in the implementation.
* before starting of implementation, please read what is a class, interface, how it should be used,
and apply this knowledge to the tasks.
* also, before starting, find in google Java Code Conventions, read it and apply it in the implementation.
* all classes should be demonstrated in Main class. 
* foe each task create a separate package in training.arrays.radionov package
* use access modifiers in right way with methods and variables.
